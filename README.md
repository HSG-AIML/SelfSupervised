## Running an experiment

Under `scripts/` folder you can find the config and shell files to run each experiment (either training or evaluation). For example to train SimCLR on COCO2014 dataset, you need to run the corresponding shell from the root directory as below:
```
$ sh scripts/methods/simclr/coco2014/train.sh
```
